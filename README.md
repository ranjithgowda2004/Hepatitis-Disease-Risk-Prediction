## Hepatitis Risk Prediction 

A small machine learning project that predicts the risk level of Hepatitis patients using basic clinical and laboratory data.
Dataset: UCI Hepatitis Dataset
Models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, KNN, AdaBoost, XGBoost
UI: Streamlit web app with simple, user-friendly inputs
Goal: Learning ML + deployment, not medical accuracy

Ready to go the setup is finished try and let me know if there are any changes that can be made to improve it  <br>
It was just made for fun to revise the concept of ML 😜
